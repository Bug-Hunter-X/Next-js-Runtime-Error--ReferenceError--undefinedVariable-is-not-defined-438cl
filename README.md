# Next.js Runtime Error: ReferenceError: undefinedVariable is not defined

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js applications where a `ReferenceError` is thrown due to the use of an undefined variable within a page component.  The error is not caught by Next.js's built-in error handling, leading to a crash on the client-side.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` file attempts to use a variable (`undefinedVariable`) that has not been declared or initialized. This results in a `ReferenceError` being thrown during runtime.

## Solution

The solution involves properly declaring and initializing the variable before using it, or using error handling mechanisms like `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle the error.  More robust error handling might involve a custom error boundary in Next.js.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.  You should see the error.

## Next Steps

This example showcases a basic error. In real-world applications, undefined variables often result from typos, logic errors, or asynchronous operations where data might not be available when expected. Always ensure your variables are properly defined and handle potential errors gracefully to create a more robust Next.js application.
